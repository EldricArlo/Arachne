# Privacy Policy for Aurora Downloader

**Last Updated:** August 26, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. Aurora Downloader is designed from the ground up to be a private and secure application that operates entirely on your local machine. This policy outlines what data the application handles and how it is used.

## 1. The Core Principle: Local First

Aurora Downloader is a **local-only** application. It does not have a central server, does not require user accounts, and does not collect or transmit any personal data to the developer or any third parties. All of your data remains under your control, on your computer.

## 2. Information We Handle (Locally)

The application needs to store some data on your computer to function correctly. This data includes:

*   **Application Settings (`config.yaml`)**: Your preferences, such as the designated downloads folder, speed limits, or proxy settings, are saved in a `config.yaml` file in the application's root directory. This is used to remember your settings between sessions.
*   **Downloaded Files**: The videos and audio files you download are saved directly to the folder you specify in the settings. We do not track the content of these files.
*   **Download History**: The application's "History" view is generated by scanning the contents of your designated downloads folder. There is no separate database of your download history; the history is a direct reflection of the files present in that folder.
*   **Cookies (`cookies.txt`)**: If you provide cookie data to download content from sites that require a login, this information is stored in a `cookies.txt` file in the application's root directory. This data is used solely to authenticate with the video websites you are downloading from and is never transmitted elsewhere.
*   **User Profile (`localStorage`)**: Your chosen username and avatar are stored using standard web browser `localStorage` technology. This is part of the browser shell (Electron) and is not accessible by the developer.
*   **Application Logs (`logs/app.log`)**: To help with troubleshooting, the application creates a log file that records operational information, such as successful initializations or download errors. This log does not contain personal information and remains on your computer.

## 3. Network Communication

By its nature, a video downloader must communicate over the network. This communication is limited to:

*   **Video Host Platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo)**: The application sends requests directly to the video hosting websites you provide URLs for. This is necessary to fetch video information (like title and thumbnail) and to download the video content itself.
*   **No Other Communication**: Aurora Downloader does **not** connect to any servers controlled by the developer for analytics, tracking, updates, or any other purpose.

## 4. Your Control Over Your Data

You have complete control over your data.

*   You can view and modify your settings at any time within the application or by editing the `config.yaml` file directly.
*   You can view, move, or delete your downloaded files and clear your history at any time using your computer's file manager.
*   You can view, edit, or delete the `cookies.txt` file at any time.
*   You can clear your profile data by using the developer tools within the application to clear `localStorage`.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the application's functionality changes. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
